			<p>"Black Lives Matter" is a movement founded in 2013 after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin" target="_blank">Trayvon Martin</a> was shot and killed unarmed by <b>George Zimmerman</b>, who was charged with murder, but acquitted after claiming that it was an act of self defense, even though Trayvon Martin was unarmed and had no intentions of hurting George Zimmmerman. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of lgbtq, trans, disabled, undocumented black people, and all black people in general. The mission or goal of the Black Lives Matter movement is to end white supremacy and end police brutality and killings towards innocent people of color.<br><br>You can read more about the movement <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
