		<h2>About BLM</h2>
		<p>"Black Lives Matter" is a movement founded in 2013 after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin"
			 target="_blank">Trayvon Martin</a> was shot and killed unarmed by <b>George Zimmerman</b>, who was charged with murder, but acquitted after claiming that it was an act of self defense. Even though Trayvon Martin was unarmed and had no intentions of hurting George Zimmmerman. Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of lgbtq, trans, disabled, and undocumented black people. The mission or goal of the Black Lives Matter movement is to end white supremacy and end police brutality and killings towards innocent people of color.<br><br>You can read more about the movement <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Why ALL LIVES MATTER Is Bad</h2>
		<p>"All Lives Matter" was a counter-protest created in response to BLACK LIVES MATTER. Yes, all lives matter. However, only <b>black lives</b> have been brutalized and killed by police for essentially no good reason. Some people believe that saying "Black Lives Matter" means that <b>ONLY</b> black lives matter, which is not true in the slightest. Saying "All Lives Matter" takes focus away from the oppression, brutalization and suffering of black people.<br><br>You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Lives_Matter" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>You can also read more about how it's harmful <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/11/12136140/black-all-lives-matter" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/us/all-lives-matter-black-lives-matter.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
